__A group project for BrickHack 2020 @RIT__
* Team Members: Scott McKinney, Ahmed Boutar, Richard Akomea
 * The goal of this app is to help people waste less food by suggesting recipes based on their leftovers
* Scans barcodes to get product information using Wegmans product api
* Wegmans does not offer an api for interaction with their recipes database, so we built a python web scraper and csv->json converter to use that data
* Webapp uses these two data sets to query Recipe JSON with the available ingredients


* The Entire webapp is contained in the BrickHack-SB-master folder
* Supporting scripts we made for scraping and cleaning are in the supporting scripts folder
